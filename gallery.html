<article>
    <p>
        My yoga journey began about three years ago in Ireland when I joined yoga
         classes in Dublin city centre. My yoga instructor inspired me with her way of 
         living and the way yoga helped her to become calm, aware and more connected with 
         her inner self.

        I have decided to sign up to Marina Yoga and Reiki School in Krabi, Thailand for 
        the TTC 200h Allianz Hatha Yoga and Meditation Course. The entire training lasted 
        one month and there  were only 3 students in each class.
