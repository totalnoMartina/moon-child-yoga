# Testing

 I changed background several times to accomodate accesibility standards and on August, 5, 2021 the purple shade might be final version

 August, 21, 2021 - I wanted to put the "back to top button" so I found my solution on https://forum.squarespace.com/topic/10886-how-can-i-add-a-scroll-to-top-button/
