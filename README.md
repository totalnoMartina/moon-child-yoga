The original idea included already known logo and the images wrapped around with text provided all by Dominika.


# Design
## Colour scheme

The colour scheme for the website was chosen in agreement with Dominka. Her logo was in dark colours and with blue representing night and deep water, while her photos are pink and purple which helped decide on the shades. Good use of website called [Coolors](https://coolors.co/97ead2-8cc7a1-816e94-74226c-4b2142) when choosing colours: 

## Typography

The Font for the website was taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=playfair) and the icons in the footer and payment icon that directs to PayPal link were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

# Credits

In making of the webpage, Dominika, the Yoga teacher, provided all of the informations in text and all images. Logo was designed by her, too. As she already is teaching yoga and having her social account that represents her yoga teachings, she had many photos. Text was taken from CV and cover letters. She helped a lot in creating the booking form page. Image of [Dali Dharma](https://bookretreats.com/teacher/dali-dhamma) was taken from his website.

While exploring options that make a good website I thought the idea of a button that brings you back to top of page when you scroll far down is a great one, I found out how to go about that on the link here: https://forum.squarespace.com/topic/10886-how-can-i-add-a-scroll-to-top-button/.
Barbara Radovic, from Croatia, helped with word-proofing the text.
///I put a border around poster and a Gallery text which I found on this link here: https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-bxqal/// which does not show...!
