        <h2>My yoga journey...</h2>
        ...began three years ago, in Ireland when I joined yoga
        classes in Dublin city centre. My yoga instructor inspired me with her way of
        living and the way yoga helped her to become calm, aware and more connected with
        her inner self. I have decided to sign up to Marina Yoga and Reiki School in Krabi, Thailand for
        the TTC 200 hrs Allianz Hatha Yoga and Meditation Course. The entire training lasted
        for one month and there were only 3 students in each class.

        <a href="https://bookretreats.com/teacher/dali-dhamma" target="_blank">Dali Dhamma</a>
        (photo above)
        from Alaska who has been sharing his knowledge about yoga and meditation
        for over 20 years, mainly teaching in China and Thailand. Dali introduced us to yoga
        philosophy (Ancient and Modern Hinduism, Buddhism, Patanjali),
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatha_yoga" target="_blank">Hatha</a> and

        Anatomy, types of yoga and their characteristics, asanas, methodology and alignment.
        The second main teacher was 
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlessioZuk" target="_blank">Alex Zuk</a>
        from Italy who has been living in India and Asia for most of his life and teaching

            Our last main teacher and the owner of the school was
            <a href="https://retreatsandvenues.com/teacher/thailand/marina-frei/" target="_blank"
                id="marina-teacher">Marina Frei</a> from Germany who has been creating her wonderful
            place for over 20 years in Krabi with a purpose of teaching people about Yoga, Meditation
            and Reiki on a high and prestigious
            standard of knowledge and experience. Marina was focused on showing us the Yin Yoga
            techniques, Yoga Nidra, Chakras, Chakras Meditation and Reiki practices.

            The 200 hours course was finished with a practical exam of conducting classes for
            90 min including meditation and written exams from each sector.
            Each teacher was examining us according to their regulations and standards.
            Successfully each of the students passed the exams and we all went to the Buddist
            temple to receive blessings from the monks.</div>
        <h2>My takeaway from this experience...</h2>
        After this magical and life transforming month with yoga and peaceful way of living
        I wanted to stay longer in the Yoga school. Marina - the owner agreed that I could
        stay on voluntary terms for another 6 months.
        My duties were to teach all types of yoga twice a day for 90 min each class
        including meditations, for five days a week.
        I must say that it was one of the most beautiful chapters in my life. I gained
        all the necessary experience, confidence, learned the best ways of giving
        instructions for each type of class. The people I met there, were so
        amazing with golden hearts and they became my dear friends and family.
        Before I left Thailand I decided to learn a few techniques of Traditional Thai
        Massage and Sport Massage. Both courses were done in Thailand, Koh Samui in 
        <a href="https://www.samuispaschool.com/" target="_blank">The Academy of Spa and Thai Massage School
        Samui by Khun Thip"</a>.
        <img src="assets/images/thai-massage-cert.jpg" alt="reception of certificate of 
        thai and sports massage" title="reception of certificate of thai and sports massage" class="home-page-photos">
        Thanks to this I can give a small massage to the students during the Yoga session
        if the class is private or if there are only a few participants. This practice allows
        a body to go into a deeper relaxation while practicing asanas.

        class="home-page-photos" title="yoga center in india, isha foundation">
        My next destination was India. The place where yoga had its beginnings.
        I had spent over two months travelling and participating in courses and ashrams activities.
        My first training was in Iyengar Yoga Centre in Goa in Arambol. My teacher was the amazing
        Sharat Aurora who was one of the first Iyengars' students and who decided to open his own
        school and ashram -
        <a href="https://www.hiyogacentre.com/dharamkot-yoga-centre-himalayas-dharamshala-india.html"
        target="_blank">Himalayan Iyengar Yoga Center in Dharamkot</a>.
        The course lasted for 3 weeks and gave me a huge understanding of alignment, asanas
        and anatomy. I have learned how to work with people after car accidents, with serious
        injuries, disabilities and with elderly people.
        Following my enthusiasm I went to Sivananda Ashram in India, Madurai for two weeks
        where there was an intense program of early morning meditation, intermediate yoga
        twice a day in Shivananda style, lectures and evening meditation. The time spent in
        this colourful and wonderful Ashram taught me discipline, patience and Karma Yoga.
        My last course in India was Simplified Kundalini Yoga in India, Pollachi where I was
        practicing Kundalini Meditation for one week. This Ashram taught me about energies and
        focusing on chakras and also the place was surrounded by one of the most beautiful
        gardens I have ever seen where everything was fresh, peaceful and kind.
        My final point of this "big learning trip" around Asia was the time in Bali of 6 months
        where I was conducting my own classes for big groups (up to 30 people) and also
        individual classes. The classes were happening in 
        <a href="https://www.baliflowtemple.com/" target="_blank">Bali Flow Temple</a>, 
        which is an artist residency for yoga, aero silks, acro yoga and fire spinning and the owner
        of the Residency is 
        <a href="https://liquidfiremantra.com/pages/about-forest-founder" target="_blank">Forest Schrodt</a> 
        from the US. This period of time where I could teach yoga, helped me to create my own style
        of teaching and become more comfortable and relaxed
        during the classes. I can honestly say that I love to teach yoga and meditation and to observe the
        positive effects and the changes on people. I invite you to enjoy yoga with me...
