            My yoga journey began in 2017, in Ireland when I joined yoga
             classes in Dublin city centre. My yoga instructor inspired me with her way of 
             living and the way yoga helped her to become calm, aware and more connected with 
             her inner self.
    
            I have decided to sign up to Marina Yoga and Reiki School in Krabi, Thailand for 
            the TTC 200h Allianz Hatha Yoga and Meditation Course. The entire training lasted 
            one month and there were only 3 students in each class.

            My main teachers were:

            <a href="https://bookretreats.com/teacher/dali-dhamma" target="_blank">Dali Dhamma</a> 
            from Alaska who has been sharing his knowledge about yoga and meditation 
            for over 20 years, mainly teaching in China and Thailand. Dali introduced us to yoga
             philosophy (Ancient and Modern Hinduism, Buddhism, Patanjali),
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatha_yoga" target="_blank">Hatha</a> and 
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viny%C4%81sa" target="_blank">Vinyasa 
             Yoga</a>, Meditation, Anatomy, types of yoga and their characteristics, asanas, 
             methodology and alignment.     

            The second main teacher was Alex Zuk from Italy who has been living in India and 
            Asia for most of his life and teaching his amazing yoga for over 40 years. Alex 
            was teaching our group PranaYama techniques, Kundalini Yoga, Osho Meditations and 
            was conducting beach yoga classes once a week.

 

            Our last main teacher and the owner of the school was 
            <a href="https://retreatsandvenues.com/teacher/thailand/marina-frei/" target="_blank"
            id="marina-techer">Marina Frei</a> from Germany who has been creating her wonderful 
            place for over 20 years in Krabi with a purpose of teaching people about Yoga, Meditation 
            and Reiki on a high and prestigious 
            standard of knowledge and experience. Marina was focused on showing us the Yin Yoga 
            techniques, Yoga Nidra, Chakras, Chakras Meditation and Reiki practices. She was
             also preparing Shamanistic Caco Ceremonies for us and the volunteers in the centre. 


            The 200 hours course was finished with a practical exam of conducting classes for 
            90 min including meditation and written exams from each sector.

            Each teacher was examining us according to their regulations and standards.

            Successfully each of the students passed the exams and we all went to the Buddist 
            temple to receive blessings from the monks.
